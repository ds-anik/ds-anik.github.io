Hi there! I'm Alireza, a PhD student at Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering (SimulaMet) in Norway. My research focuses on energy-efficient machine learning and sustainable AI systems. I work on optimizing inference for large language models, with a particular emphasis on reducing energy consumption and latency in GPU-accelerated workloads. My work spans decoding strategies, model compression, and systematic performance evaluation. My focus is building scalable AI systems that reduce compute and energy use while staying reliable and practical.
