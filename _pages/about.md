Hi there! I'm Alireza, a researcher at Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering (SimulaMet) and a PhD Fellow at OsloMet University in Norway. My research focuses on energy-efficient machine learning and sustainable AI systems. I work on optimizing inference for large language models, with a particular emphasis on reducing energy consumption and latency in GPU-accelerated workloads. I study resource-efficient machine learning, exploring how our design choices influence inference efficiency and developing methods to reduce computational costs while maintaining reliability and practicality. My supervisors are [Michael Alexander Riegler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vd_ApDoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pål Halvorsen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hru0ei0AAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Data Scientist at Schlumberger (now SLB), developing ML solutions for subsurface applications in the oil and gas industry. I applied NLP techniques to extract insights from scanned well reports and deployed computer vision models to automate equipment inspection and infrastructure monitoring, enhancing operational efficiency and safety.
